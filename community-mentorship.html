                I am so grateful that after many years of not offering an interpretation service for our deaf community, D’Lisa and her team at ____ were able to provide this support pro-bono. As a non-profit, we do not have a budget to provide this service for our members and it was a treat to see our gardener enjoying all the interesting information about different gardening techniques. She was even able to communicate with other gardeners after the event was over. Thank you D’Lisa, Nicole and Lucas!

                Hi my name is Michelle Letts. I learned ASL at Bloomsburg University. My major was American Sign Language interpreting. After college I had an internship. My mentor was with D’Lisa Robinson. She is truly an Amazing interpreter. D’Lisa is a freelance interpreter. She brought me to jobs all over Washington DC, Maryland, and Virginia. I was fortunate enough to experience and learn a great deal. During my internship with D’Lisa, while I was interpreting, situations would occur and I would not know how to handle them. Fortunately, she was there to help me. I surely enjoyed having her there during those moments. After I finish my internship I start working full time as an ASL interpreter. I meet a lot of people, I really enjoy it. Today, I interpret and teach ASL. I love my job.

              <p>
                As a novice, concrete jungle native interpreter, my journey into the Deaf world flourished once I met D’Lisa Robinson. While accompanying D’Lisa, I found academic achievement, as well as successful employment with Federal Agencies. As a student at Gallaudet University’s BAI program, Ms. Robinson was a wonderful and passionate mentor, offering help and guidance when I stumbled, as well as applause when I excelled. D’Lisa waded through my excuses and doubts, never wavering from her confidence in my abilities, even when I felt defeated. She always saw me as the certified and accomplished interpreter, and held me to the highest of standards. These standards turned her vision into a reality, and allowed me to brave the NIC with confidence. D’Lisa invested in me knowing at times that I would fall, but she was always there to catch me; she would set me down right back on my feet, look me in the eye, and say ‘you’ve got this.’ Today, I still find myself expounding upon D’Lisa’s guidance; it has continuously led me additional Federal Agencies, as well as charitable opportunities, of which I’m proud to have been apart.
                The end of last year, I had a revelation as to exactly how much D’Lisa’s guidance had flourished in me. Ms. Robinson and I each booked the same conference independently and found our way back to each other. To have been momentarily placed on the same pedestal as my mentor, was all the reassurance I needed to know that D’Lisa lead me on the right path.
